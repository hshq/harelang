# NAME

hare - compile, run, test, and inspect Hare programs and modules

# SYNOPSIS

*hare* -h

supplied, it also prints information about the build parameters, in an output
format that's consistent for machine reading: the first line is always
*hare $version*, and subsequent lines give configuration values in the form of a
name on its own line unindenteed, followed by any number of values, each on its
own line indented with a single tab.
