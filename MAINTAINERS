Guidelines for subsystem maintainers
------------------------------------

Maintainers have write access to hare-announce, make use of it to announce
notable or breaking API changes.

Any changes which affect modules outside of your jurisdiction should be subject
to some general review before being pushed upstream.

Descriptions of section entries and preferred order
---------------------------------------------------

	M: *Mail* patches to: FullName <address@domain>
	R: Designated *Reviewer*: FullName <address@domain>
	   These reviewers should be CCed on patches.
	L: *Mailing list* that is relevant to this area
	W: *Web-page* with status/info
	B: URI for where to file *bugs*. A web-page with detailed bug
	   filing info, a direct bug tracker link, or a mailto: URI.
	C: URI for *chat* protocol, server and channel where developers
	   usually hang out, for example irc://server/channel.
	P: Subsystem Profile document for more details submitting
	   patches to the given subsystem. This is either an in-tree file,
	   or a URI.
	T: *SCM* tree location.
	F: *Files* and directories wildcard patterns.
	   A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
	   F:	drivers/net/	all files in and below drivers/net
	   F:	drivers/net/*	all files in drivers/net, but not below
	   F:	*/net/*		all files in "any top level directory"/net
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple F: lines acceptable.
	X: *Excluded* files and directories that are NOT maintained, same
	   rules as F:. Files exclusions are tested before file matches.
	   Can be useful for excluding a specific subdirectory, for instance:
	   F:	net/
	   X:	net/ipv6/
	   matches all files in and below net excluding net/ipv6/
	N: Notes (free-form)
