The datetime module implements the common international "Gregorian" chronology,
based on the astronomically numbered proleptic Gregorian calendar, as per ISO
8601, and the common 24 hour clock. It provides [[datetime]], a representation
of civil date/time and an extension of the [[chrono::moment]] type, optimized
for dealing with the Gregorian chronology.

Datetimes are created with [[new]], [[now]], or with one of the various "from_"
functions. Alternatively, use a [[mock]] to construct a datetime piece-by-piece,
by field assignements or by parsing strings with [[parse]].

[[datetime]] instances are designed to be always valid and internally
consistent. They should be treated as immutable, and their fields as private.
All functions herein return valid datetimes (or appropriate errors), and never
modify a datetime's value, even if passed as a pointer, which is used only for
internal caching.

[[datetime]] fields are accessed, evaluated, and cached via the various "field"
functions ([[year]], [[month]], [[day]], etc). Accessing or modifying a
[[datetime]]'s fields directly is discouraged. To mutate a datetime in code, the
use of the [[builder]] interface is recommended.

[[datetime]]s may be localized to different [[chrono::timezone]]s via the [[in]]
function. The "field" functions will evaluate the correct values accordingly.
You'll find a standard selection of world timezones in the [[time::tzdb]]
module.

To convert datetimes to and from strings, use [[parse]] and [[format]].

For arithmetics, use [[diff]], [[add]] and [[hop]]. Note that calendrical
arithmetic is highly irregular with many edge cases, so think carefully about
what you want.
