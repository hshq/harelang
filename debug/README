The debug module implements various runtime debugging services. It is enabled by
default when you build programs in debug mode (you can disable this by building
in release mode with the -R flag to hare(1)). It provides detailed backtraces in
various error conditions, including:

- Assertion failures
- Built-in assertions (e.g. for the "as" operator)
- Segmentation faults
- Arithmetic exceptions (e.g. divide by zero)
- Bus errors
- Stack overflows

In order to accomplish this, the debug module does some logic on @init which
rigs up [[rt::]] with debugging hooks and installs the relevant signal handlers
globally. If you set your own signal handlers for terminating signals (e.g.
SIGFPE) that the debug module handles, they will override the debug hooks.

This module may also be used explicitly to inspect details of the running
program -- for instance, you can trace the call stack with [[walk]].
