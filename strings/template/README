This module provides support for formatting of large or complex strings beyond
the scope of [[fmt]]. A template is compiled using [[compile]], then executed
with [[execute]] to print formatted text to an [[io::handle]].

The template format is a string with variable substituted using "$". Variable
names must be alphanumeric ASCII characters (i.e. for which [[ascii::isalnum]]
returns true). A literal "$" may be printed by using it twice: "$$".

	const src = "Hello, $user! Your balance is $$$balance.\n";
	const template = template::compile(src)!;
	defer template::finish(&template);
	template::execute(&template, os::stdout,
		("user", "ddevault"),
		("balance", 1000),
	)!; // "Hello, ddevault! Your balance is $1000.
