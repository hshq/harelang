Incomplete list of Hare trees
-----------------------------

Hare development is semi-decentralized. Anyone can stand up the infrastructure
required to pursue their goals in the project, and various trees are organized
and developed independently of upstream before being submitted for broader
consideration. Various trees are used by specific maintainers to prepare their
changes, by interest groups to maintain some detail (e.g. a specific arch), or
temporary trees used to collaborate on large proposals.

This document lists notable trees that may be of interest to contributors.
Maintainers (see ./MAINTAINERS) are welcome to update this document without
review if they want to set up a new tree. Anyone in the Hare community,
regardless if they possess committer permissions, is welcome to stand up a tree
on their own initiative and send a patch to the hare-dev mailing list adding it
here.

The format of this document is based on ./MAINTAINERS, see that document for an
explanation of the syntax.
